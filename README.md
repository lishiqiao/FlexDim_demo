# Flexi_demo

## Overview
This repository provides a demo implementation of the proposed hyperspectral light-field reconstruction framework.  
It includes:
- A simplified pipeline for testing,
- An example dataset (25-view hyperspectral data of one scene),
- Sample input and output results.

This demo allows reviewers to reproduce the workflow and verify the feasibility of our method.  
The complete dataset and full codebase will be released after acceptance.
